This is my first potential entry to Kaggle. It's based from this particular kernel - [[Churn Modelling]](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling) where
the dataset wants us to classify whether the customer left the bank or continues to be a customer for it.

Used streamlit to build the multipage web app. Inspired by [[Nancy Chelaru's notebook]](https://github.com/nchelaru/random-forest-streamlit/blob/master/app.py)

**Requirements**

aside from the usual, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, seaborn, we also have:

plotly
streamlit
scipy
xgboost

Will continuously update this kernel. Currently deciding where to host it. 

Did some of the modelling through Google Colab with the file - colab_churn.ipynb 

Once you figure this all out, just run:

streamlit run app.py through terminal.
