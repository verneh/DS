# Verne's Github for Data Science
...it's where we dump our projects.

[Bottling Machine Repair Simulation](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/Bottling%20Machine%20Repair%20Simulation) - Discrete event simulation to repair and check for spare machines for a fictituous bottling company.

[Churn Predictor App](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/Churn%20Predictor%20App) - Code for predicting whether a person is a customer in a bank or not.

[Churn Modelling](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/ChurnModelling) is taken from Kaggle. Determined models to be used for Churn Prediction. Only the code for my first multipage app built through streamlit.io. 

[Energy](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/Energy) is inspired from dennislamcv1's work on eDx Data Science for Architecture, Engineering and Construction. Time Series, Clustering, and prediction through Regression for energy.

[Family Income and Expenditure (FIAE)](https://github.com/verneh/DataSci/tree/master/FIAE) is an exploratory data analysis on the average Filipino income with some examination of the relationships between variables.

[FastAI](https://github.com/verneh/DataSci/tree/master/FastAI) are projects built off of FastAI for Deep Learning. Currently have an image classifier for an environment whether its polluted or not.

[MNIST](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/MNIST) is part of the Coursera Course for Deep Learning where you get to classify images of digits using Keras / TensorFlow

[NLP](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/NLP) is a work in progress.

[Recommender](https://github.com/verneh/DataSci/tree/master/Recommender) is my version of a Spotify Recommender.

[Simulations](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/Simulations) is where i try to do some simulation modeling through ModSimPy. Currently have a project on bike sharing utilization.

[ULMFit](https://github.com/verneh/DataSci/tree/master/ULMFit) was meant as an application to fellowship.ai. Deep Learning with Sentiment Classification for an airlines company.
