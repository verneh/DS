# Verne's Github for Data Science
...it's where we dump our projects.

[ANN](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/ANN) is a simple Artificial Neural Network for FashionMNist.

[AWS](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/AWS) recent datajam for sentiment analysis using Sagemaker and Comprehend.

[Certificates](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/certificates) - some of the online courses I've taken.

[Churn Predictor App](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/Churn%20Predictor%20App) is code for app that predicts whether a person is a customer in a bank or not.

[Churn Modelling](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/ChurnModelling) dataset is taken from Kaggle with a little customization from my part. Determined models to be used for Churn Prediction. Only the code for my first multipage app built through streamlit.io. 

[Energy](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/Energy) is taken from eDx Data Science for Architecture, Engineering and Construction. Time series, clustering, and prediction through regression for energy on a target building.

[Family Income and Expenditure (FIAE)](https://github.com/verneh/DataSci/tree/master/FIAE) is an exploratory data analysis on the average Filipino income with some examination of the relationships between variables.

[FastAI](https://github.com/verneh/DataSci/tree/master/FastAI) are projects built off of FastAI for Deep Learning. Currently have an image classifier for an environment whether its "contaminated" or not.

[Kaggle](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/Kaggle) is a folder dedicated to some of the entries I made in Kaggle. Current one on where I peaked at #32. It's about classifying pairs of sentences (consisting of a premise and a hypothesis) into three categories - entailment, contradiction, or neutral. It's a combination of transfer learning and BERT.

[Machine Learning](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/Machine%20Learning) excerpts from Cognitive.AI

[MNIST](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/MNIST) is part of the Coursera Course for Deep Learning where you get to classify images of digits using Keras / TensorFlow

[NLP](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/NLP) is a work in progress. It currently houses the ff: Coursera NLP scripts, a wikipedia scraping done on 2020 Premier League, and insights while scraping 1,000 tweets from Danny Green's Game 5 NBA Finals performance.

[Object Detection](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/Object%20Detection) is a weekend project using Tensorflow Hub to scan one image. Used FasterRCNN - Inception Resnet V2.

[Recommender](https://github.com/verneh/DataSci/tree/master/Recommender) is my version of a Spotify Recommender to see if songs from another playlist can be added to my own playlist.

[Scala](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/Scala) excerpts from Cognitive.AI

[Simulations](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/Simulations) is where i try to do some simulation modeling through ModSimPy. Inside is a project on bike sharing utilization between two locations. Also included is a bottling machine repair simulation through SymPy.

[SQL](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/SQL) is just SQL things.

[ULMFit](https://github.com/verneh/DataSci/tree/master/ULMFit) was meant as an application to fellowship.ai. Deep Learning with Sentiment Classification for an airlines company.

[VGG-19](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/VGG-19) dataset used with StyleGAN of an image that feels more like an image filter.

[WorldQuant](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/WorldQuant) miniprojects for part II of WorldQuant University's Machine Learning Module.
