# Verne's Github for Data Science
...it's where we dump our projects.

[Churn Modelling](https://github.com/verneh/datasci/tree/master/ChurnModelling) is taken from Kaggle. My first multipage app.

[Family Income and Expenditure (FIAE)](https://github.com/verneh/DataSci/tree/master/FIAE) is an exploratory data analysis on the average Filipino income with some examination of the relationships between variables.

NLP is currently a work in progress.

[Recommender](https://github.com/verneh/DataSci/tree/master/Recommender) is my version of a Spotify Recommender.
